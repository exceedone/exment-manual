![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_setting1.png)  

### Composite unique key setting
By setting multiple columns as unique keys, it is possible to prevent duplicate registration due to specific combinations when registering new data.  

- Select two or three types of columns that you want to prevent duplicate registration by a specific combination.  
- When registering new data, an error will occur if the value to be registered matches the registered value for any of the setting columns.  

Example: In the case of the settings shown in the image below, using the "Next scheduled date" and "Name" as unique keys prevents the same name from being registered multiple times on the same next scheduled date.  
![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_setting2.png)

※ If you want to perform duplicate judgment on only one type of column and prevent duplicate registration, set the unique column to YES in the [custom column setting](/column.md).

### Compare two columns
Compares the two columns when creating and updating data. You can save only if the column values ​​match the set conditions.  
If they do not match, an error message is displayed.  
Please use the following patterns.  

- The "start date" can be saved only before the "end date".  
- The value of "X" can be saved only when it is greater than or equal to the value of "Y".  
- "Person in charge" and "Confirmer" can be saved only when they are different.  

![Compare two columns](img/table/compare1.png)

#### Handling when not entered
If one or both items are not entered, the result will differ depending on the selected conditions.  
Here, "true" is described when it can be saved normally, and "false" is described when an error occurs.  

- **Matches A and B**: True if both values ​​are blank. False if only one is not entered.  
- **A and B do not match**: True if only one of the values ​​is not entered. False if both are blank.  
- **Other**: <span class = "red"> Always true. </span> This is because dates and numbers are generally incomparable when the value is empty.  
If you do not want to leave it blank, please make the required settings in the custom column settings and custom form settings.  

#### Handling by column type
- Comparison of magnitude (A is greater than B, A is less than B, A is greater than or equal to B, A is less than or equal to B) can only be made with the following column types:  

    - Integer
    - Decimal
    - Currency
    - Date
    - Time
    - Date and time

- If you try to compare with other column types, it will always be true.  

- Strictly speaking, when saving this setting, if the column types are not the same, you need to generate an error.  
(Because the magnitude relationship between "integer" and "date and time" cannot be compared)  
Currently, such verification is not performed.  
Make the appropriate selection of the two column types.  

#### Other
- If you want to compare with 3 or more columns, compare with special conditions, compare values ​​of other tables, etc., create [Plug-in validation](/plugin_quickstart_validate). Please give me.

### Heading display column setting
In the custom column settings, there is an item "Use in label".  
With this setting, you can control the wording to be displayed when displaying search bar candidates or displaying a list of options.  

For example, suppose you have a table called "Customer Information" as shown below.  
Assume that the customer information table has information such as "customer code", "customer name", "phone number", and "mail address".  

![Heading display column setting](img/table/label1.png)    

When you enter a search word in the search bar, search suggestions are displayed, and you want to display it as follows.  
`` (Customer code) (Customer name) ''
![Heading display column setting](img/table/label2.png)    
  
In that case, on the extension setting screen of the custom table, set as follows for the column you want to display as a label.  
![Heading display column setting](img/table/label3.png)  
  
By registering in this way, when entering text in the search bar at the top of the page, it will be displayed like this as a candidate.  
By registering columns in order from the top on the extended setting screen, candidate character strings are displayed in that column order.  
![Heading display column setting](img/table/label5.png)  

If you want to display "E-mail address", please add "E-mail address" column.  
![Heading display column setting](img/table/label4.png)  
![Heading display column setting](img/table/label6.png)  
  
In the custom table settings, there is an item "Display ID on label".
![Heading display column setting](img/table/label7.png)  

If this is set to YES, the word "# (id)" will be added to the beginning of the label.
![Heading display column setting](img/table/label8.png)  

#### Other
- If this heading display column setting is not registered, the value of the first column is displayed in the custom column setting.
- If the value of the first column is empty in the custom column settings, display the ID.
- IDs can be added at the beginning of the label. It cannot be added anywhere else.

### Data automatic sharing settings

> For data sharing settings, first check the [Overview of Roles / Permissions in Exment](/permission) page.

When saving data, you can automatically share the data with the organization or user that is set as the column value.  
Please use it for the following purposes.  

- When creating a new data "contract information", edit authority is automatically added to the user assigned to the column "main person in charge".  
- When the data "contract information" is updated, the viewing authority is automatically added to the organizations assigned to the column "related organizations".
- When creating a new data "Task Management", edit permission is automatically added to the user assigned to the column "Person in charge".

※"User" or "Organization" is required in advance for the column of the custom table.  

#### Example
If such a column setting is defined in the Customer Management table,

![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_share3.png)

Make the setting "Add" Edit "permission to the user assigned to the column" Person in charge "at" When creating a new "."
![Custom table screen] (img/table/table_extended_share1.png)

After that, when creating new data with the person in charge as user "user1",
![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_share2.png)

This contract information is shared with the user "user1" with edit privileges.

![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_share4.png)

#### Setting method

You can select "When creating new" or "When updating".

- ##### Target column

- ##### Target authority
When sharing, select whether to share with edit permission or view permission.


#### Share sync settings
By default, when the trigger is "when updating", even if the value of the target user / organization is changed, the originally set shared information of the user / organization is not deleted and remains shared. ..

![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_share5.png)

By changing the settings, when updating data, the users / organizations set in the column and the users / organizations other than the updated user can be deleted from the sharing settings.  

![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_share6.png)

To change this setting, set the option setting "Synchronize automatic data sharing settings when updating" to YES.

![Custom table screen](img/table/table_extended_share7.png)

By using parameter variables, you can flexibly set the values ​​displayed as headings.  
When expert mode is enabled, format string input items are displayed on the extended setting screen.

![Heading format column setting](img/table/label_format1.png)  

Use [parameter variables](/params) to display the values ​​stored in the data as headings.  
Example: When displaying "User name < admin@admin.admin >" in user information.
${value:user_name}&lt;${value:email}&gt;  
![Heading format column setting](img/table/label_format2.png)  

By inputting in this way, you can set the items to be displayed as headings.
